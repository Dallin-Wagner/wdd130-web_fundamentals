        and outdoor hobbies. In 2022 I summited the Grand Tetons with a group of my friends, 
        I play Golf in my free time and for mulutple years
        I was a tennis coach for the local high school here in Rexburg. 
        In 2024 I married my wife and we are loving life on Rexburg. My wife is amazing for a lot of reason,
        and one of them is that she has her masters in food scince studying cheese.
